# Cloud
perspective.Virtualization technology has been widely used to virtualize single server into multiple servers, which not only creates an operating environment for a virtual machine-based cloud-computing platform but also potentially improves its efficiency. Currently, most task scheduling-based algorithms used in cloud computing environments are slow to convergence or easily fall into a local optimum. Scheduling of Virtual Machines and Task is a challenging technique in Virtualized Cloud Environment. In my work, a Scheduling Algorithm is designed and implemented using Java Programming based on the problem specified above in order to decrease the overall power consumption and efficiently utilizing the resources available.
